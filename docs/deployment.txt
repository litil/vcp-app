# DEPLOYMENT

The goal is to deploy from Rocketeer with only one command line but it still
does not work.


## MANUAL DEPLOYMENT

For now, we can deploy on an EC2 instance (staging environment) manually. First,
log on into the machine :

  ssh -i guillaume-key-pair-virginia.pem ec2-user@ec2-54-235-28-122.compute-1.amazonaws.com

Then deploy manually :
  cd /var/www
  git clone https://github.com/litil/vcp-app.git
  sudo chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user vcp-app/
  cd vcp-app/ && mv * ../ && cd ..
  # create .env file if it does not exist
  sudo service httpd restart
  composer install
  sudo chmod -R 777 storage
  sudo chmod -R 777 bootstrap
  sudo service httpd restart

## AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT

 With Rocketeer, we can deploy from our codeing environment automatically by
 running :
  rocketeer deploy

This works and it deploys the Laravel app into /home/guillaume. By default, it
uses the staging environment, so now it deploys it on the EC2 instance.

We have an issue when copying files from the current folder into the /var/www
folder. For some reason, we get a 403 error.
